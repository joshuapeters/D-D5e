# D-D5e
Trying out a web interface for D&amp;D 5e

To Run:

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. Run command **npm install**
3. Close and Reopen your command line (this is for commands in package.json to be able to be found, as path does not update unless you close and reopen cmd)
3. Run command **npm start**
	* If this does not work, you may have to run command **npm install -g typescript** and then repeat step 3.
